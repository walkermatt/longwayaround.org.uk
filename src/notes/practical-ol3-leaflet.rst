I ran a 2 hour workshop at `OSGIS 2014
<http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/osgis/home.aspx>`_ introducing OpenLayers 3 and
Leaflet.

    A hands on introduction to using OpenLayer 3 (OL3) and Leaflet to display
    spatial data on the web. The workshop will introduce the two libraries, the
    underpinning concepts and strengths of each, and take delegates through
    creating a series of examples.

The `full workshop documentation is available
<http://astuntechnology.github.io/osgis-ol3-leaflet/>`_ if you'd like to follow
along at home.
